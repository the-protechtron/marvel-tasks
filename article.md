# Recent CrowdStrike Outage

Recently, CrowdStrike experienced a significant IT outage caused by a faulty security update. The incident, which began on July 19, 2024, impacted millions of devices globally, particularly those running Microsoft Windows. The update led to widespread blue screens of death (BSODs), effectively rendering affected systems inoperable.

> The **blue screen of death** (BSOD) -- also known as a stop error screen, blue screen error, fatal error or bugcheck -- is a critical error screen that can be displayed by Microsoft Windows operating systems (OSes).

The root cause was identified as a logic error in the configuration file of the CrowdStrike Falcon sensor. This error disrupted numerous critical services, including airlines, banks, and other essential infrastructures. In response, CrowdStrike and Microsoft collaborated to issue recovery tools and detailed remediation steps to address the issue.

Additionally, cyber threat actors exploited the chaos caused by the outage to launch phishing attacks and distribute malware, further complicating the recovery efforts. CrowdStrike has been actively providing updates and guidance to help users mitigate these threats and restore their systems.

The outage has underscored the importance of rigorous update testing and robust cybersecurity measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.
